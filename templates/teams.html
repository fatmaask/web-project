                    <h4>The last champion of the International</h4>

                    <p class="teams-p">Newbee is a team that emerged in early 2014 during the Chinese reshuffle that happened prior to the fourth International tournament. Originally dubbed "Dream Team 2", the rumors started after captain xiao8 made a post on his QQ micro-blogging page after LGD Gaming's win in the Dota 2 League Season 4 in Las Vegas, saying "New start in 2014 after 3 years in LGD", forever Dream 5.". The rumors later placed TongFu and Invictus Gaming members Mu, Faith, Hao and ChuaN in the team together with xiao8. A few weeks later, the team was announced to be competing in the third season of the Sina Cup, but the roster was not yet revealed. As Invictus Gaming had announced that Faith would be staying with the team, rumors now placed ZSMJ and Banana in the team. After TongFu announced on the 20th of February that the team would step down from the competitive tier and focus on the amateur scene, and Banana was announced to be staying in iG as a backup player, many now saw the veterans ZSMJ and KingJ as the last two members of the new "Dream Team". On the 23rd of February 2014, the Chinese ACE Dota organization announced that the transfers were complete and the now dubbed team "Newbee" consisted of xiao8, Mu, Hao, KingJ and ZSMJ. Later team Newbee announced on its QQ micro blogging page that the club was officially established on the 28th of February, and that a transfer fee of 500,000 RMB (~81,000 USD) had been agreed upon between the new club and xiao8's old team LGD Gaming.

                    <p>The organization later also announced that former RisingStars player Sydm was part of the team in the role of coach, and former Noah's Ark player Li was the teams leader. Li is a veteran WC3 DotA player who played with xiao8, Yao, DD and DDC on team Dream, which may or may not have been the origin of the teams first rumored name Dream Team. </p>

                    <p class="teams-p">Natus Vincere (Latin for "born to win"), often abbreviated as Na`Vi, is a Ukranian multigaming organization which was founded in 2009 as a Counter-Strike team after the collapse of the team KerchNET.</p>

                    <p>Its DotA section was created in October 2010 with the pickup of Goblak, XBOCT, Mag~, Deff-, and Axypa. After Mag~ and Deff- left the team they instead acquired Danylo "Dendi" Ishutin and Ivan "Artstyle" Antonov. The team was later invited to the first version of The International 2011, eventually winning it after defeating the Chinese team EHOME 3-1 in the finals. </p>
